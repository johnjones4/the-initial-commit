This blog is meant to be a medium for the personal stories of open source
developers. Each published interview will feature multiple aspects of the
individual: everything from his or her backgrounds, to why he or she got into
development, to why he or she decided to become a contributor to the open source
community.

The objective of this series is to show the pride and commitment these
individuals have in the work they do, and that their work is meant for the good
of the community.

If you are an open source contributor and would like to be interviewed, let me
know using the contact information below, or reach out or sign up if you are
interested in just getting involved!

If you are an open source software developer and would like to be featured,
please get in touch at
