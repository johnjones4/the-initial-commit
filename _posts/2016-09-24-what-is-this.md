Virtually all developers rely on open source software as part of their daily
lives. It powers everything from development environments to servers and
everything in between. Even non-developers use open software without even
realizing it because open source software is either a part of to the application
they are using or the entire platform is open source.

With the challenges both developers of the best projects have in maintaining
their projects and developers of new projects have in reaching a critical mass
of users, I wanted to create a site that showcases some of the best members of
the open source community as well as the community's unsung heroes â€“ of which
there are many.

This blog is meant to be a medium for those stories. Each published interview
will feature multiple aspects of the individual: everything from his or her
backgrounds, to why he or she got into development, to why he or she decided to
become a contributor to the open source community.

The objective of this series is to show the pride and commitment these
individuals have in the work they do, and that their work is meant for the good
of the community.

If you are an open source contributor and would like to be interviewed, let me
know using the contact information below, or reach out or sign up if you are
interested in just getting involved!
